    happiest birthday my princess! you have been on my mind for 3 years or more now i guess. yet you are still incredible, you might think i say so many things to you so i must not mean it. BUT you're mistaken my princess. i mean each and every SINGLE word. the sorrys to my compliments to my miss yous to my i love yous. EVERYTHING i meant it. you are wonderful. you are just out of this world. i'm genuinely so blessed to have you not only as my friend but as my close friend. it's unbelievable that someone so beautiful and awesome and funny and intelligent and smart and did i mention beautiful? and so fucking kind is MY friend. princess you changed me so much. i cannot thank you enough you are the best. you changed this little boy so much, this attention starved boy who said he had TB just so people would like him, to a man who would do anything for his princess. i don't know the lengths i'd go to make you happy (some may even be illegal) but i'm sorry. i say i would do these things but never did. i don't know why i get afraid at times. BUT i'll do my fucking best to do the things i say and prove i love you the most.
    <br>
    i've loved you from the very first moment i met you princess. and i'm proud to say i'll never stop loving you till my last breath.
    i really love you anjali.
    <span class="signature">yours forever,<br>‚Äì zii</span>
